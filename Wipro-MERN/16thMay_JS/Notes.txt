ES2015 is the latest version of JavaScript programming language. It is the first major upgrade to JavaScript since 1997. It was approved in June 2015 by ECMA international, an association responsible for approving ECMA standards which programming languages like JavaScript, CoffeeScript and TypeScript follows.

The term vanilla script is used to refer to the pure JavaScript (or we can say plain JavaScript) without any type of additional library.

The language is called ECMAScript. The ECMAScript standard defines the rules, details, and guidelines that the scripting language must observe to be considered ECMAScript compliant. ... JavaScript is a general-purpose scripting language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.


ECMAScript (/ˈɛkməskrɪpt/) (or ES) is a JavaScript standard meant to ensure the interoperability of web pages across different web browsers. It is standardized by Ecma International according to the document ECMA-262.


JavaScript is a subset of ECMAScript. JavaScript is basically ECMAScript at its core but builds upon it. Languages such as ActionScript, JavaScript, JScript all use ECMAScript as its core. As a comparison, AS/JS/JScript are 3 different cars, but they all use the same engine... each of their exteriors is different though, and there have been several modifications done to each to make it unique.
